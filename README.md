# FinderTainment
this repository will contain two folders, one for the frontend and one for the backend.
each will contain the relevant crew's needs.

##Rules!
you are a team Player, you mess things up; the whole team turns against you...
you dont want that. that's why you need to folow the rules:

- CLONE IT, NEVER FORK IT: forking the project will create a new repository at your Github page. you dont want to work alone.

- THE MASTER BRANCH SHOULD ALWAYS BE DEPLOYABLE: meaning you **Never** change it directly. when working on code, create
  new branches for new features and merge them into Master when theyâ€™re completed **and working**. 
  - BRANCHES SHOULD ALWAYS REPRESENT FEATURES: when creating a thread, name iit after the feature you are going to add in this branch.
    nobody cares about "idans_thread" but "user_login" is something everyone will notice.
    
  - TRY NOT TO WORK ON SIMILIAR BRANCHES: similiar branches often mean working on same files, which increase the chances of conflicts,
    we cant fully eliminate conflicts but try to avoid them.
    
- MERGING BRANCES TO MASTER IS A SUPER CALCULATED STEP: you had your team staying up all night working on code, you dont want to override
  anyone's hard work! when merging:
  1.  pick one teammante to be the "Reviewer": he would be the only one merging the branches.
  2.  have everyone push their branchs.
  3.  in github everyone should see their pushed branches, let them click "Compare & pull request"
  4.  have them write a pull request, evryone should add notes regarding of what thay changed in the program, and under "Reviewers"
      have them select you.
  5.  merge the code and be carefull! you dont want to mess things up. **one branch at a time**
 
- WRITE A SOLID CODE: if you dont know what SOLID code is: [Here is a link to an article to learn about it](https://medium.com/web-engineering-vox/how-to-write-solid-code-that-doesnt-suck-2a3416623d48)
  try at least stick to "Single responsibility" and "Open for extantion closed for modification".
  
- THRERE IS NO SUCH THING AS CODE WITHOUT COMMENTS: writing a function? add a last step of summerizing it, and write it in comments above
  the function. **be specific!** write about what it does, what its purpose, what it gets and what it returns.. 
  **WE DONT HAVE TO SPEND HOURS READING YOUR CODE AND CRACKING OUR HEAD ABOUT WHAT YOUR SHIT DOES**

- SHARE LINKS OF EXTERNAL OR UNCOMMON API DOCUMENTATION: using an external API that you just learned? somthing uncommon that
  most chances are that we dont know it either? share its documentation and enlighten us with your knowledge
